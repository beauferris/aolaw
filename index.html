              Ali is a new lawyer who is also new to Red Deer. Born in Calgary,
              Ali completed a Bachelor`s of Arts in Economics at the University
              of Calgary in 2016. Ali received an full-ride scholarship to
              attend law school at Georgia State University-College of Law in
              Atlanta, Georgia. He spent 4 years in Atlanta where he fought to
              help Defendants in the overburdened and overbearing American
              criminal justice system.
            </p>
            <p>
              As an intern with the Georgia State Public Defenders Office, Ali
              worked in the Complex Felony division. He gained experience
              defending persons accused of serious felonies, including drug
              trafficking and murder. Even some cases that received national
              attention. His greatest contribution, and proudest moment as a
              lawyer, came when he drafted the legal argument that eventually
              led to the Georgia Court of Appeals decision expanding
              constitutional protections against unreasonable searches. He
              continued to volunteer with the Public Defender`s Office after
              graduation.

              Ali graduated law school in January 2020 and returned home to
              Alberta. In August 2020, he successfully completed the required
              exams for internationally trained lawyers. Ali joined Vesta Law as
              an articling student in May 2021, and has been fighting for
              clients across central Alberta. As a lawyer he has successfully
              helped clients with issues in the realm of family law, criminal
              law, civil litigation, real estate and wills/estates.

              In his free time Ali enjoys, playing tennis, collecting Pokemon
              Cards and being overly critical of movies.
